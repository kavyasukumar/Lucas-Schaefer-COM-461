<p> The graph above depicts all US deaths attributed to the Covid-19 virus within a 120 day window from February 1st to May 30th 2020. </p>
<p> If we round up we can calculate to see that, on average, <mark>736</mark> Americans are dying from the virus every day within this window. </p>
<p> This year the election takes place on November 3rd. As of June 1st there are 155 days until the November election. If we assume that this average remains constant, we can guess that an additional <mark>114,080</mark> Americans will die from Covid-19 in that time.  </p>
<p> That total, in addition to the deaths from the first 120 days, would put the US death toll somewhere around <mark>202,843</mark> on November 3rd.</p>
<p> Because 2016 was our most recent presidential election and the Republican candidate Donald Trump is running in both we'll use data from that election to help predict how many voters may die from Covid-19 before election day. </p>
<p> According to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/">PEW research center</a>, the voter turnout in 2016 among all eligible Americans was 55.7%. If we take that percentage into account with our predicted death toll, we can expect around <mark>112,984</mark> of those dead to actually be voters. </p>

<br>
<p> This data from the 2016 election puts the US vote tally at around 137,537,000. If we compare our death toll prediction to this tally, it tells us that coronavirus deaths would eliminate <mark>0.00082%</mark> of electoral voters.
